# LeetCode Solutions in C#

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository, written in C#. This project showcases my problem-solving skills, C# proficiency, and commitment to writing testable code. Solutions are organized by difficulty in separate files, with corresponding custom unit tests.

## Repository Structure
The solution (`LeetCode-Solutions-CSharp.sln`) contains two projects:

### Solutions
- Houses my LeetCode solutions, grouped by difficulty in subfolders.
- **Folders**:
  - `Easy/`: Individual files named `[ProblemName]Solution.cs` (e.g., `TwoSumSolution.cs`).
  - `Medium/`: Individual files named `[ProblemName]Solution.cs` (e.g., `AddTwoNumbersSolution.cs`).
  - `Hard/`: Individual files named `[ProblemName]Solution.cs` (e.g., `MedianOfTwoSortedArraysSolution.cs`).

### Tests
- Contains custom unit tests for each solution, mirroring the difficulty-based folder structure.
- **Folders**:
  - `Easy/`: Test files named `[ProblemName]Tests.cs` (e.g., `TwoSumTests.cs`).
  - `Medium/`: Test files named `[ProblemName]Tests.cs` (e.g., `AddTwoNumbersTests.cs`).
  - `Hard/`: Test files named `[ProblemName]Tests.cs` (e.g., `MedianOfTwoSortedArraysTests.cs`).
